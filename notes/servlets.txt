what is java?

=========================

c/c++  - system programming (compiler, driver software etc...)

python - machine learning , AI etc...

where java is used ?

     - application programming ( most preferred to build web based applications)

     - 3 types of applications:

      1. standalone - JSE  ( core java + GUI programming)

      2. web and enterprise application  - JEE

      3. mobile application - JME

==================================================

 JEE :

     - component based

     - there are 2 types of components

         - Web components

             - servlets & jsp

         - Bussiness components

             - Ejb


   - All JEE components are container managed components (life cycle of jee components are managed by the container)

   - two types of containers

        - web container (or web server)

                - Tomcat, Jetty

        - application container (or application server)
            
                 - Jboss, WebLogic, Webshpere, GlashFish etc


 
   Web application contains:

         1. html
         2. CSS
         3. javascript
         4. images
         5. servlets
         6. jsp
         7. configuration files (e.g web.xml)


   Folder structure need to follow :

     root directory 

       		- *.html
       		- *.js
       		- *.css
       		- WEB-INF

          		- classes
              			- *.class

          		-lib 
              			- *.jar
              
          		- web.xml

===================================================

   softwares required:

         - jdk

         - tomcat

  HTTP : 

   -  communication protocol between client and server on web

   - client send http req and server send http response.

   - IN the server machine we need to install HttpServer to handle request and response

   - HttpServer has a limitation>  It can handle only static content ( static web pages)

   - To generate dynamic content, HttpServer take the help of some other component ( called servlet)


  Why servlet?

     - to generate dynamic content

  What is a servlet?

          - Servlet is one of the server side jee component.

          - Servlet is a class written according to servlet api specification

          - servlet api is defined in two packages:

                  1. javax.servelt.*

                  2. javax.servlet.http.*;

           - two types of servlets:

                1. GenericServlet

                2. HttpServlet


   How to create a servlet:

   1. create a class which extends HttpServelt

   2. override doGet() or doPost() method


==================================

 1.  doGet vs doPost  :


      Get Request: 

          - using for getting something from the server

          - request parameters appending in the URL

           - url length is limited so using get request we can send only limited data

      Post Request:

          - using for saving something on to the server

          - request parameters appending in the body of the request

          -  we can send unlimited date using post request

          - to send sensitive data use post request


=====================================================================

  Request Dispatching:

   two mechanisms:

     1. forward

     2. include
